<p class="unindent"><b>THE RAG SOCIABLE.</b> A Quaint old fashioned entertainment which is always sure to
please. Libretto by Edith S. Tillotson. Music by various Composers. The dialog is very
spicy and interesting, and humor and pathos are beautifully blended in the various musical
selections. The characters include Mrs. Winters and her two daughters Betsy and Maria,
Miss Jemima Rush, Mrs. Bassett, Mrs. Collins, Mrs. Salina Grey, the Allen twins (elderly),
Mrs. Martha Ann Hall, Miss Eliza Hall, Mrs. Jane Tompkins and Amanda Tompkins. The

<p class="unindent">A fine entertainment for a class of women or girls, Ladies’ Aid, Christian Endeavor and
Epworth League Societies, etc. Price, 25 cents per copy.</p>


<p class="unindent"><b>LOVE FINDS THE WAY, or The Detective That Father Hired.</b> Music by Chas. H.
Gabriel. Words by Rev. Wm. Danforth, author of “The Old District School,” etc. A
highly amusing farcical song-skit, with four characters: A Determined Young Lover,
an Irate Father, a Daughter with a Will of Her Own, and an Aiding and Abetting Mother—parts:
tenor, basso, soprano and alto.</p>

<p class="unindent">This composition consists of singing and dialog for each part and will serve to enliven any
entertainment. The music is moderately easy, melodious and should be available in
practically all communities. This work consists of some 12 pages in sheet music form.
The story is as follows: A father, who objects to his daughter having a beau, believing that she is planning to elope
with an unknown young man, advertises for a detective to ferret the matter out. The young lover answers the advertisement,
and the father hires him to detect the culprit, promising to pay him “anything within reason.” When
the young lover’s true identity is disclosed, he demands as his reward, for having detected himself, the hand of the
daughter. The irate father objects. The daughter eventually convinces him that true love was the real detective in
the case, and the parental consent is given. Price, $1.50; 50 per cent discount.</p>


<p class="unindent"><b>THE OLD DISTRICT SCHOOL.</b> A farce in two acts (new version). Book by Wm. Danforth. Music arr. by Geo. F.
Rosche. This is a burlesque on the district school of 100 years ago. Ezekiel Simpkins, the teacher, is the central character.
His costume is a tight Prince Albert coat, with brass buttons, or a worn and faded “claw-hammer” coat, colored
vest cut low; stock collar, with large black tie; trousers, “high-water,” with a patch of other color on one knee; well-worn
shoes. Bald gray wig and “side” whiskers. The costumes of the pupils are in keeping with those of the teacher.
The characters all read their lines from the book, so that there is very little to be memorized and for this reason this
work can be prepared in a very short time. Price, postpaid, 50 cents per copy.</p>

<p class="unindent"><b>THE CHAPERON.</b> A humorous Operetta in three Acts. Libretto by Wm. Danforth. Music by Geo. F. Rosche.
“The Chaperon” is a humorous operetta designed for church choir and young people’s societies. It will be found available
in all communities in which seven young men and seven young ladies who sing can be found. The music is bright,
tuneful, easy to learn and easy to remember. The dialogue is witty, clean, wholesome and entertaining. Price, postpaid,
60 cents per copy.</p>


<p class="unindent"><b>THE VISION OF HENSEL.</b> An evening with the old songs. The old songs of childhood,
youth, love, war and home. Libretto by Ellan N. Wood. There is no friend like
an old friend and after all there are no songs we love quite so much as the old ones.
This cantata furnishes a beautiful medium for the introduction of the old songs which
we all know and love. There is just enough libretto to the work to form a continuous
chain of thought throughout, and we know of no cantata that will afford such a pleasing
entertainment at such a small expenditure of labor. The book is well worth its price if
only to secure this fine collection of old home songs. Full of sentiment, humor and
pathos and decidedly new and fresh in construction. Price, 30 cents per copy, postpaid;
$3.00 per dozen, not prepaid; add 3 cents per copy for postage.</p>

Castle. Music by Geo. F. Rosche. “The Spinsters’ Club” is a humorous operetta

yet easy to learn and memorize. The dialogue is witty, pleasing and entertaining.

</div>

<p class="unindent">Two mysterious pieces of paper fall into the hands of the children, one
being found by the BOYS and one by the GIRLS. The meaning of the inscription
on each remains a mystery until it is discerned that by placing
the papers together they have the message that the “Old Witch” of the
North has captured “Santa” and holds him in an ice prison at the North Pole.
Of course there could be no “Merry Christmas” without their “patron saint”,
so guided by the “Fairy Godmother” they start for the North Pole to rescue
him. The “Old Witch” endeavors to block the rescuers’ way by the assistance
of “Old Zero” and the “Snow Fairies” but when they learn that
the snow drifts they are piling up are to aid in keeping “Santa” from his
usual Christmas activities they get the “Sunbeam Fairies” to come to their
aid and melt the snow, while they bind with a frozen cord the “Old Witch,”
who is found indulging in a nap which she takes only once every hundred years. With the “Old
Witch” powerless and in their control the Rescue of Santa is an easy matter.</p>

<p class="unindent">Tho’ belated somewhat by his enforced stay at the North Pole, the children are glad to become
his “aides” in spreading a “Merry Christmas” through all the world. This is a very clever plot,
well worked out, and will make a decided hit for the Christmas season. 4 Boys and 5 Girls with
any number of Fairies. Time about 1 hour. Price 25 cents.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
